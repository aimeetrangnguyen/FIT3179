        <h1> Instant ramen ratings in Asia <i class="em-svg em-ramen" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="STEAMING BOWL"></i></h1> 
        <p>Instant ramen or instant noodle is one of the most common and popular fast-foods around the world, especially in Asia. It was invented by <span class = "italic">Momofuku Ando </span>, who is the founder of Nissin Foods in Japan. Nissin is also the first brand to introduce instant ramen under cup packaging design. Ramen noodle is loved by many people because of its convenience and cheap price. In each country and region, the flavour of ramen could change accordingly to the local taste. In this visualisation, we will explore the quality (stars rating) of instant ramen in Asia based on regions, style of packaging and flavours.</p>

            <h2>Overall ratings</h2>
            <p> The average ratings of ramen ranges from around <span class = "italic"> 3.2 to 4.2 </span> across the countries
              in Asia. The majority of them fall in the range of <span class = "italic"> 3.2 - 3.6 </span> stars . <span style = 'color: #fed16f;' style= 'font-weight:bold'>Vietnam </span> is the one 
with the lowest ramen ratings. This is understandable since Vietnamese prefers rice noodle
such as Pho or vermicelli. It's interesting to see that Japan - where the instant ramen is 
originated from, only got 3.98 average stars ratings. The value is actually higher compared to the general but it's still below Indonesia, Malaysia and Cambodia - those countries that achieve more than 4 stars.

            <p> This isotype graph shows the number of five-stars ramen brand in each country. The five-stars brands only present in 7 countries, and not suprise to see that Japan, where the ramen origins, ranks number one. Previously, we see that Japan does not get the highest average ratings but here, it is the one that owns the highest number of five-stars ramen brands. The reason might be because of the immense number of brands in Japan, which then causes the diversity in the ratings. </p>

               <h2> The different styles of ramen </h2>
            <p> There are five styles of ramen which are: pack, bowl, cup, tray and box. Even though the first product of instant ramen came under cup style, pack style has become more and more popular and now it turns out to be the most produced ramen packaging style. The main advantage of pack over bowl or cup is that the package is more compact and it uses less plastic. Normally, the bowl and cup style would have a plastic fork attached with it  and also an extra clear plastic wrap for protection. Thus, pack ramen is normally cheaper than bowl and cup ramen. Although box style has the least amount of production but box ramen gets the maximum stars in both Japan and Malaysia.  </p>
            <p> Singapore gets the highest average ratings for pack style while Malaysia ranks number one in ratings for bowl style. The cup style has the highest rating in Myanmar and Japan achieves that highest rating for tray style. </p>

          <h2> Most popular flavours of ramen </h2>
          <p> Top 10 most flavours of ramen that have been produced are: spicy, chicken, beef, seafood, pork, shrimp, sesame, tonkotsu and vegetarian. China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea are the four countries in Asia where many of their cuisines taste spicy. Thus, no wonder there is a massive production of spicy ramen. While sesame flavour is mainly produced in Taiwan, Japan possesses a large number of tonkotsu ramen. Itâ€™s interesting to see that vegetarian is also a popular option in Taiwan and also Thailand. </p>
